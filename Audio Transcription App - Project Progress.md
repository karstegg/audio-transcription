# Audio Transcription App - Project Progress

## Session: March 11, 2025

### Initial State
- Basic audio transcription app using Google's Gemini API
- Simple HTML interface with file upload and transcribe button
- JavaScript code to process audio files and send to Gemini
- Debug console functionality

### Issues Identified
1. **UI Issues**
   - Inconsistent element IDs between HTML and JavaScript
   - Lack of visual feedback during processing
   - Poor error handling

2. **Technical Issues**
   - Base64 encoding size increase not accounted for (33-37% larger)
   - API errors with large files due to hitting size limits
   - Empty MIME type errors when chunking files
   - Summarization instead of verbatim transcription
   - Video file failures after first chunk in multi-chunk files

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Core Improvements** (merged to `improved-ui-and-functionality` branch)
   - Fixed element ID inconsistencies
   - Added visual status indicators and improved styling
   - Created configuration file (`config.js`) for better organization
   - Reduced chunk size to account for base64 encoding (15MB instead of 30MB)
   - Added proper MIME type preservation for file chunks
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - Fixed transcription quality by instructing Gemini to provide verbatim output
   - **Note**: Commit 79cc2c4 processed video files directly without audio extraction and worked for single-chunk videos

2. **Speaker Diarization** (implemented in separate `feature-diarization` branch)
   - Added toggle UI for enabling/disabling speaker identification
   - Implemented prompt engineering approach to have Gemini identify speakers
   - Enhanced chunking process to maintain speaker consistency across chunks

3. **Transcript Utilities** (implemented in `feature-transcript-utilities` branch)
   - Added cancel/reset button to abort ongoing transcription
   - Added copy transcript button using Clipboard API
   - Implemented summary generation for meeting transcripts
   - Added copy summary button
   - Improved UI with better button styling and feedback
   - Added toast notifications for user actions
   - Implemented audio extraction from video files to fix multi-chunk video issues

### Current State
- Three branches in the repository:
  - `improved-ui-and-functionality`: Core improvements with direct video processing (works for small videos)
  - `feature-diarization`: Additional feature for speaker identification
  - `feature-transcript-utilities`: Enhanced usability with utility features and proper video handling

- App now handles:
  - Both audio and video file transcription
  - Large files via improved chunking
  - Proper MIME type detection
  - More accurate verbatim transcription
  - Meeting summary generation
  - Clipboard operations
  - Cancellation of ongoing requests
  - Audio extraction for reliable video processing

### Next Steps
1. Complete testing of the core functionality branch
2. Merge the `improved-ui-and-functionality` branch
3. Further test and refine the diarization feature
4. Test the transcript utilities features
5. Consider implementing hybrid approach for video processing:
   - Use direct method for single-chunk videos (faster)
   - Use audio extraction only for multi-chunk videos (more reliable)
6. Possible enhancements:
   - Export options (TXT, SRT)
   - Direct microphone recording
   - Language selection for multilingual transcription
   - Timestamp generation

### Video Processing Investigation
- Discovered commit 79cc2c4 ("Fix transcription quality and chunk reliability") handled videos differently
- This version processed video files directly without audio extraction
- Preserved MIME types using Object.defineProperty
- Worked well for smaller, single-chunk videos
- Failed for multi-chunk videos with "Request contains an invalid argument" error after first chunk
- Current solution uses audio extraction which is more reliable but slower
- Potential hybrid approach could optimize for both speed and reliability
